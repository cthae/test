blurb:
    heading: "What?"
    text: "I find elegant solutions to complex problems. Whether in the realm of analytics tracking and reporting or in the realm of team leading, documentation and setting up proper business processes."
blurb1:
    heading: "How?"
    text: "Using best practices under a thick layer of common sense, sprinkled with generous professional communities support from places like Measure, Liberta IRC and Stack Overflow"
blurb2:
    heading: "Whurrr?"
    text: Uh, honestly, it's just a blank site quickly made with Netlify. Netlify is pretty cool, actually... If you're in devops :). The site is to be used for Adobe Experience platform to get me started with extension development for Launch. Yes, Experience platform onboarding requires you to have a named email on a domain that would have an actual site on it. They could use some Adobe Target themselves, lol. If you need me, find me on linkedin, slack, or wherever.
